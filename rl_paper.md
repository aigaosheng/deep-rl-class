# Bonus: Learn to create your own environments with Unity and MLAgents

**You can create your own reinforcement learning environments with Unity and MLAgents**. Using a game engine such as Unity can be intimidating at first, but here are the steps you can take to learn smoothly.

## Step 1: Know how to use Unity

- The best way to learn Unity is to do ["Create with Code" course](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code): it's a series of videos for beginners where **you will create 5 small games with Unity**.

## Step 2: Create the simplest environment with this tutorial

- Then, when you know how to use Unity, you can create your [first basic RL environment using this tutorial](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_20_docs/docs/Learning-Environment-Create-New.md).

## Step 3: Iterate and create nice environments

- Now that you've created your first simple environment you can iterate to more complex ones using the [MLAgents documentation (especially Designing Agents and Agent part)](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_20_docs/docs/)
- In addition, you can take this free course ["Create a hummingbird environment"](https://learn.unity.com/course/ml-agents-hummingbirds) by [Adam Kelly](https://twitter.com/aktwelve)
